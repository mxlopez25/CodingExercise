## Coding Exercise

This project is a coding exercise for an interview.

The project is structured in the following way:

Languages: Kotlin

Design Pattern: MVVM

HTTP Client: Retrofit

Testing: UI Testing (End to End)

UI Layout: XML

Recycler View Pagination: True

Notes:

- Didn't saw necesarry use OAuth for the API request, given that it allows an amount perfect for development as long as the rate of data request is controlled.
- Decide to go with E2E/UI testing for the simplicity and given that the most challenging part was handling the resources the API provided by default. The Unit testing for ViewModels, Coroutines and mocked network request would have beat the purpose of the time in required time section.
